# terminal-game-gradient-descent
Repository for terminal game Gradient Descent, a Codecademy portfolio project

This is my final project for Codecademy's CS101 course. It's a very simple, text-based terminal game in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure. I wrote the script in Python as required for the course.

I'd like to improve the code, do some debugging, and add "levels", but I want to move forward in Codecademy, so this is version 1.0.

To play the game, run the script called game.py.
